        "Experiment": "Implement SAPLMA (Situation-Aware Probing for LLM Assertions) to analyze internal probability distributions when LLMs generate statements. Compare probability patterns between true statements (e.g., 'Jennifer Aniston is an actress') and false ones with similar word counts. Develop probes that examine how low probability assessments in internal states can contradict confident surface outputs. Test on statements with typos vs factual errors to understand classification mechanisms.",

Examine hidden representations and confidence levels at each generation step to identify when models recognize contradictions but continue generation.
